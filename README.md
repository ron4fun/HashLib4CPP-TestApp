# HashLib4CPP-TestApp
**HashLib4CPP-TestApp** is a free and simple windows application that implements [HashLib4CPP](https://www.github.com/ron4fun/HashLib4CPP) and serves as support in testing and showcasing the library reliability.

**Test Algorithms:**

    Non-Cryptographic 32-bits Hash Algorithms: Murmur2,  XXHash32.

    Checksum Algorithms: Adler32, CRC16_BUYPASS, CRC32_PKZIP, CRC32_CASTAGNOLI, CRC64_ECMA. 

    Cryptographic Algorithms: GOST, Grindahl, HAS160, Haval, MD2, MD4, MD5, RIPEMD, 
	RIPEMD128, RIPEMD256, SHA0, SHA1, SHA2-224, SHA2-256, SHA2-512, SHA2-512-224, 
	SHA2-512-256, SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-512, Snefru128, Snefru256.

**Tested Enviroments:**
     
    Windows 10 ;).

**How To Use.**

Unzip file and Run.

**Note:**

	The [500MB >>] button in the application refers to a 500MB bytearray in memory filled
	with 0x0. So, whenever you click on the button the hash of the 500MB memory space
	is computed using the currently selected hash type.
